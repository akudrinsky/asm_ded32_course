# Hack of a program.
Misha Shishatskii, https://github.com/Shishqa/ sent me files, I compiled them (the problem was he is on Linux, and I am on MacOS, so we needed to have several compile attempts to rewrite Linux version to MacOS one). I didn't see the source files themselves, only file macos_security_check. Then I tried to hack it - write something to achieve "Access granted" message.

try1: Patch a macos_security_check file

try2: Write a password, that would be considered correct by the program.
